# Letter-to-number

LetterTonumber is a package developed to convert letters into their respective number in the English alphabet and the conversion of numbers to their respective letters

This package was developed for Encipher. Encipher can be found at https://github.com/lightman210567/Encipher
This package will only be developed when change is required by Encipher.

All letters and numbers are outputted as you would expect in the English alphabet. However a space is always converted to 0, so please allow for this in your code.
